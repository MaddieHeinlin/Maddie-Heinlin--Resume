        <div class="subheading mb-5">Business Major</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Maddie Heinlin and I am a first year business student and UC Riverside. I grew up in Pleasanton, California and moved to Riverside about two months ago. I have one year of experience working at a pet store where I learned things like how to manage customers. I also learned how to take care of animals and make sure everything was organized and neat. I spent all four years of highschool playing Varsity softball and that taught me alot. I learned how to manage my time really well because of my busy schedule. I worked very hard to get good grades and be good at softball and it payed off because I am studying business right now at UC Riverside and I am on the softball team. I also would work for my Aunt doing PR packages that got sent out to hundreds of people. I would use my organization to put the packages together in an efficient way. I beleive myself to be very social and I do well listening to instructions but also giving them out. <br><br>

        Growing up in Pleasanton was very nice and I had a great support system. My mom is very smart as she went o Columbia for her Masters degree. She helped me alot with my major and the school aspect of my life. My dad helped more with softball and he made me the player I am today. I am so grateful for both of them in my life and I kn ow i will always appreciate their love and support. Family is very imprtant to me and I belive that it is the key to everything. My mom was very strict and that cam with its pros and cons. She held my to high stanards but it become very stressfull very quickly. She really reinforced that I was to focus on school before sports and it makes a lot of sense. The term is Student Athlete because students come first. It is so important to have a strong support system in your life so that even when you struggle you will have someone there for you. It does not matter if those people are related to you or not all that matters is that they have your back.<br><br>

        I am not sure what I want to do with my life but I know I am on the right path. A good degree is just the right starting point and I am already on that track. Business and economics is very important because it helps show how the world runs and how we can predict the future. There are so many options of things you can do with a business degree amd I am excited for that possibility. UC Riverside is a very reputable school and if you do well there you will be well prepared for life outside of college. As long as you continue to work hard you can accomplish whatever you want. There are also many subsections of business such as economics, marketing and administration. The important thing is to find something that interests you and that you can see yourslef enjoying.
